<h1>Strategic Evaluation of GRC Tools for Healthcare Organization</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

I developed a strategic framework for evaluating and selecting Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) tools aligned with the organizationâ€™s complex regulatory landscape (HIPAA, HITECH, CMS) and operational requirements. The recommended solutions improved patient data protection, enhanced compliance, and supported long-term risk management and healthcare innovation.

<h2>Assessment</h2>
The framework emphasized integration with electronic health record (EHR) systems (Epic, Cerner), automated incident management and reporting, role-based access and audit controls, workflow automation for claims processing, and scalability to support enterprise healthcare operations.
Through this evaluation, I recommended a targeted set of solutions:<br>
- NAVEX<br>
- LogicGate<br>
- OneTrust<br>
- RSA Archer<br>
- SAI360<br>
- Onspring Healthcare Suite<br> 

Each chosen for its ability to address healthcare-specific compliance challenges, strengthen data governance, and enhance privacy management.<br>

By aligning tool capabilities with regulatory and operational needs, my recommendations enabled the organization to strengthen HIPAA compliance, safeguard sensitive patient data, improve EHR governance, and streamline claims oversight processes. This initiative positioned the organization for long-term compliance success, stronger risk management, and sustainable innovation in healthcare delivery.
